# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the DocuMind AI document management platform with improved UI design, database integration, authentication system, and audit authorization features. The enhancements will transform the current client-side application into a full-stack solution with proper user management and secure audit capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: UI Color Scheme and Visual Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want an improved and modern color scheme throughout the application, so that I have a better visual experience and the interface feels more professional and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any page of the application THEN the system SHALL display a cohesive color palette that improves readability and visual hierarchy
2. WHEN a user switches between light and dark modes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent color relationships and contrast ratios
3. WHEN a user interacts with buttons, forms, and navigation elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback with appropriate hover and active states
4. WHEN a user views the dashboard, upload, search, and admin pages THEN the system SHALL display consistent styling across all components
5. IF a user has accessibility needs THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements for all text and interactive elements

### Requirement 2: PostgreSQL Metadata Database Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want document metadata stored in PostgreSQL, so that I can ensure reliable data persistence, querying capabilities, and proper relational data management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store metadata (title, upload date, file type, size, user ID, tags) in PostgreSQL
2. WHEN a user searches for documents THEN the system SHALL query PostgreSQL for metadata matching the search criteria
3. WHEN the system needs to retrieve document information THEN the system SHALL fetch metadata from PostgreSQL with proper indexing for performance
4. WHEN a document is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding metadata from PostgreSQL
5. IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate user feedback
6. WHEN the system starts up THEN the system SHALL automatically create necessary database tables if they don't exist

### Requirement 3: Milvus Vector Database Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want semantic search capabilities powered by vector embeddings, so that I can find documents based on content similarity and meaning rather than just keyword matching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL generate vector embeddings and store them in Milvus
2. WHEN a user performs a search THEN the system SHALL query both PostgreSQL for metadata and Milvus for semantic similarity
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL combine metadata and vector similarity scores to provide relevant results
4. WHEN a document is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding vectors from Milvus
5. IF Milvus is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to metadata-only search and notify the user of limited functionality
6. WHEN the system processes documents THEN the system SHALL handle different file types (PDF, DOC, TXT) for vector generation

### Requirement 4: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely log in and sign up for the system, so that I can access my documents and maintain data privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the signup page THEN the system SHALL allow account creation with email, password, name, and department
2. WHEN a user attempts to log in THEN the system SHALL authenticate credentials against the database and create a secure session
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide a JWT token for subsequent API requests
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session and clear authentication tokens
5. IF a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages without revealing system information
6. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page and require re-authentication
7. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL validate email format, password strength, and required fields

### Requirement 5: Audit File Authorization System

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to control which users can access detailed audit information, so that sensitive audit data is only available to authorized personnel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user accesses the audit section THEN the system SHALL display detailed audit logs and user activity
2. WHEN a non-admin user attempts to access audit details THEN the system SHALL deny access and display an appropriate message
3. WHEN audit events occur (document uploads, deletions, searches) THEN the system SHALL log these events with user ID, timestamp, and action details
4. WHEN an admin views audit logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by user, date range, and action type
5. IF a user's role is changed THEN the system SHALL immediately update their access permissions for audit features
6. WHEN audit data is accessed THEN the system SHALL log the audit access event itself for security tracking
7. WHEN the system stores audit logs THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized modification

### Requirement 6: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage user roles and permissions, so that I can control access to different features based on user responsibilities and ensure staff cannot access sensitive financial or detailed audit information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is created THEN the system SHALL assign a default role (staff, manager, admin, or auditor)
2. WHEN a staff user logs in THEN the system SHALL only allow access to their own documents and basic upload functionality
3. WHEN a manager user accesses the system THEN the system SHALL allow viewing all documents and basic audit logs but NOT detailed financial information
4. WHEN an admin user accesses audit features THEN the system SHALL provide full access to detailed audit logs, financial data, and user management
5. WHEN an auditor user accesses the system THEN the system SHALL provide read-only access to all documents and comprehensive audit trails including financial data
6. IF a staff user attempts to view detailed invoices or financial audit data THEN the system SHALL deny access and display an appropriate message
7. WHEN role permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL verify permissions at both the API and UI levels
8. WHEN an admin manages users THEN the system SHALL allow role assignment and modification with immediate effect

### Requirement 7: Database Connection Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust database connection handling, so that the system maintains reliable connectivity to both PostgreSQL and Milvus databases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish connections to both PostgreSQL and Milvus databases
2. WHEN a database operation fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN database connections are lost THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection
4. WHEN the system cannot connect to databases THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide graceful degradation
5. IF database operations timeout THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts appropriately and inform users
6. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL properly close all database connections
